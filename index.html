            Hello! I'm Alex Johnson, a passionate web developer and designer. My journey into web development began in
            2020, and I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities of creating interactive and visually appealing
            websites. I am currently studying Computer Science at XYZ University and working on various web development
            projects. I enjoy experimenting with HTML and CSS to build beautiful and functional web pages. This website
            is one of my personal projects showcasing my skills in these technologies.

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides
            the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.
            HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages and are used to define the content and structure of a
            webpage.<br><br>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
            written in HTML. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a website. It
            allows developers to create visually engaging and responsive web designs. With CSS, you can apply styles to
            HTML elements and ensure that your website looks great on different devices and screen sizes.
